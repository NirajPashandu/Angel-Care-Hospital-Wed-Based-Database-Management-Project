This project is a web-based database management system designed specifically for hospital environments. It provides a simple yet functional platform to manage hospital and patient data efficiently, enabling healthcare staff to keep track of patients, staff, and hospital resources in an organized manner. The system focuses on CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, ensuring that all data is easily accessible, editable, and securely stored.

Key Features:-

Patient Management: Add, view, update, and delete patient records, including personal details, medical history, and treatment information.

Hospital Staff Management: Maintain staff records, including doctors, nurses, and administrative personnel, with roles and contact details.

Secure Login System: A basic authentication system ensures that only authorized personnel can access or modify the data.

Data Storage: Utilizes MySQL as the relational database to store hospital and patient information securely. PhpMyAdmin is used for database management and queries.

User-Friendly Interface: Clean and responsive web pages designed with HTML and CSS for easy navigation and operation.

Backend Functionality: PHP scripts handle all interactions between the frontend and the database, ensuring smooth data flow and efficient management.

Technology Stack

Frontend: HTML, CSS

Backend: PHP

Database: MySQL, PhpMyAdmin

Purpose and Learning Goals

The primary goal of this project is to serve as an educational tool for beginners in web development and database management. It demonstrates how web applications interact with databases to perform operations such as adding, updating, retrieving, and deleting data. By building this project, developers gain hands-on experience with backend programming, database design, and integrating frontend interfaces with database-driven functionality.

This system can be further expanded to include features like appointment scheduling, billing, and reporting dashboards, making it suitable for real-world hospital management applications.

Whether you are a student, a beginner in web development, or someone interested in healthcare management systems, this project provides a solid foundation for understanding how web-based database applications work.
